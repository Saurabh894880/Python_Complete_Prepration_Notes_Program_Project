# Custom Exceptions :
# - You can also create custom exceptions by defining a new class that inherits from Python’s built-in Exception class.
# - This is useful for application-specific errors.
# - Let's see an example to understand how.

class AgeError(Exception):
    pass

def set(age):
    if age < 0:
        raise AgeError("Age cannot be negative.")
    print(f"Age set to {age}")

try:
    set(-5)
except AgeError as e:
    print(e)
