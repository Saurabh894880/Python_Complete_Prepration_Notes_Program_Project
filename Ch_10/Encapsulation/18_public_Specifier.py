# 1. Public Members
# Public members are variables or methods that can be accessed from anywhere inside the class,
#  outside the class or from other modules.
#  By default, all members in Python are public.

#  They are defined without any underscore prefix (e.g., self.name).
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name   # public attribute

    def display_name(self):   # public method
        print(self.name)

emp = Employee("John")
emp.display_name()   # Accessible
print(emp.name)      # Accessible
