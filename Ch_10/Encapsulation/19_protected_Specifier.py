# 2. Protected members
# Protected members are variables or methods that are intended 
# to be accessed only within the class and its subclasses.
#  They are not strictly private but should be treated as internal.

# In Python,
#  protected members are defined with a single underscore prefix (e.g., self._name).

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name       # public
        self._age = age        # protected

class SubEmployee(Employee):
    def show_age(self):
        print("Age:", self._age)   # Accessible in subclass

emp = SubEmployee("Ross", 30)
print(emp.name)        # Public accessible
emp.show_age()         # Protected accessed through subclass
